# Admin Generator

Admin Generator is a package that helps you quickly scaffold your typical CRUD admin interfaces. It generates the code based on the existing (migrated) table in the database. It uses an admin UI template from our other package `brackets/admin-ui`.

This packages is part of [Craftable](https://github.com/BRACKETS-by-TRIAD/craftable) (`brackets/craftable`) - an administration starter kit for Laravel 5. You should definitely have a look :)
